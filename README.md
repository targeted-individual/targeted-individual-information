# targeted-individual-information

This document is if you're hearing random voices and implanted thoughts and impressions and visionary imagery or vivid dreams and visions.

This is often called v2k or voice to skull. There is a loop of random experiences designed to cause you to suffer. You have others monitoring your mind and reacting to your thoughts and thinking. You may also experience directed energy weapons and sensations on the skin.

Your feelings may be implanted. And they will try get you to believe lies. You find it difficult to work out what you thought and what they wanted you to think.

A targeted individual feels they are in extreme danger and that people are following you. You feel you will be murdered.

When you lay down to sleep, the enemy attacks you and tries to deprive you of sleep.

You feel you're being tortured.

Many people believe it is the government doing this, the CIA, FBI or other secretive organisations.

The attack changes the more you learn. They pretend to leave but come back.

# The Answer: It's hard to accept

The enemy will do everything in its power to keep you where you are, mentally and in belief and feelings.
